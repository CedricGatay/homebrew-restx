Homebrew-restx
==================

This repository contains an unofficial formula for [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) for [restx](http://www.restx.io).

Installing Homebrew-restx formula
--------------------------------------

Just `brew tap CedricGatay/restx` and then `brew install restx`.

You can also install via URL:

     brew install https://raw.github.com/CedricGatay/homebrew-restx/master/restx.rb

Docs
----

`brew help`, `man brew`, or the Homebrew [wiki](http://wiki.github.com/mxcl/homebrew).

Future

If this formula works well enough, it might be relocated under the restx umbrella organization on Github.
